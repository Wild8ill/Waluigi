At the present moment in time, WaluigiBot is only running for a select group of people, however I plan to open it up in the future. For updates on that however, you can initiate a conversation with the bot [here](https://t.me/WaluigiBot)

Don't Want to wait??

You can cr
eate your own spinoff of this bot. All you'll need to get started are a [Twitter API key](https://developer.twitter.com/), a [Telegram bot of your own](https://telegram.org/blog/bot-revolution), and a bit of common sense. Oh, and these dependencies.

Dependencies
-----

Heads up, this project is python3 only so make sure to use pip for python3.(This might mean using `pip3` instead of `pip`.)

[Beautiful Soup 4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) Just head on over to the site and follow the install instructions. Couldn't be easier.

[Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/) Same rules apply, super quick and simple to install.

And finally,

[Python Telegram Bot] (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-telegram-bot) Takes all the hard work out of this for you.

Can I contribute?

By all means go ahead. It'd be awesome to get my first pull request, and I'm open to any suggestions, especially as this is my first time doing anything with either the Twitter OR Telegram API's, so any feedback is much appreciated :)
